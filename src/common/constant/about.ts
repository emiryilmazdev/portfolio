    Hello! Thanks for stopping by my personal website.
</p>
<p>
    I'm Emir YÄ±lmaz, a Frontend Developer specialized in Web3 and blockchain technologies since 2019. 
    I focus on building modern, performant, and user-centric DeFi applications using React, Next.js, and TypeScript. 
    My expertise spans the entire frontend development lifecycle - from smart contract integrations to responsive UI design, 
    deployment processes to performance optimization.
</p>
<p>
    I'm passionate about the intersection of traditional web development and blockchain technology. 
    My technical stack includes HTML5, CSS3, React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+), and Tailwind CSS for frontend development. 
    For Web3 integration, I work with Ethers.js, Web3.js, WalletConnect, and various DeFi protocols including ERC-20 and BRC-20 tokens.
</p>
<p>
    Throughout my career, I've successfully collaborated with international clients on remote projects, 
    developing everything from DApps and presale platforms to real-time trading bots and comprehensive DeFi platforms. 
    I've led the development of complex projects like BRC-20 DeFi platforms featuring staking, farming, bridge, and launchpad functionalities.
</p>
<p>
    I believe in creating not just functional applications, but exceptional user experiences. 
    My approach combines technical expertise with strong UI/UX design skills, ensuring that complex blockchain interactions 
    remain intuitive and accessible to users.
</p>
<p>
    I'm always excited about new challenges in the rapidly evolving Web3 space and look forward to collaborating on innovative projects!
